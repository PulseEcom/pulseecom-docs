# PulseEcom – Business Requirements

## 1. Purpose
PulseEcom is a **real-time, multi-layer analytics and anomaly detection platform** for e-commerce businesses.  
It ingests operational data from retailers and marketplaces, enriches and scores it using **pre-trained models + client-specific models**, continuously learns via drift detection and threshold recalibration, and delivers actionable insights and alerts via APIs and integrations.

---

## 2. Goals
1. **Faster Issue Detection** – Identify fraud, sales drops, operational bottlenecks, and campaign issues in seconds.  
2. **Actionable Intelligence** – Deliver business-friendly summaries from complex analytics.  
3. **Continuous Model Adaptation** – Maintain high accuracy through automated learning and threshold recalibration.  
4. **Operational Efficiency** – Reduce manual data monitoring and reporting effort.  
5. **Revenue Protection** – Minimize losses caused by undetected anomalies or delayed detection.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation** with per-client configuration and API keys.  
- Event ingestion via **real-time APIs** and **scheduled batch uploads**.  
- Multi-layer event processing:
  - Ingestion Layer
  - Enrichment Layer
  - **Scoring Layer** (Pre-trained models + Calibration Layer + Client-specific models)
  - **Learning Layer** (Threshold recalibration, drift detection, retraining jobs)
  - Delivery Layer (alerts, insights, APIs)
- AI-generated summaries of anomalies and trends.
- Configurable alerting and reporting.

### Out of Scope (MVP)
- Dedicated front-end dashboards (initial focus on APIs/integration).
- Automated remediation actions.
- Complex external integrations beyond APIs/webhooks.

---

## 4. Target Users
- **E-commerce Analysts** – Monitor KPIs and anomalies in real time.  
- **Marketing Teams** – Track and react to campaign performance changes instantly.  
- **Fraud & Risk Managers** – Detect suspicious or fraudulent patterns quickly.  
- **Business Executives** – Receive concise, AI-generated summaries for strategic decisions.

## 5. Key Business Requirements

### 5.1 Multi-Tenant Capability
- Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation.
- Tenant-specific configuration for ingestion rules, thresholds, and alert settings.

### 5.2 Data Ingestion
- Support REST APIs for real-time event submission.  
- Support batch file ingestion for historical or bulk data.  
- Handle core e-commerce event types (orders, clicks, impressions, returns).

### 5.3 Real-Time Processing
- <1 minute latency from event ingestion to alert delivery.  
- Standardize, validate, and enrich incoming events.

### 5.4 Scoring Layer
- Use **pre-trained models** for cold start.  
- Apply **Calibration Layer** for threshold adjustments per tenant.  
- Incorporate **client-specific models** where available.

### 5.5 Learning Layer
- **Threshold Recalibration** – Adjust scoring thresholds dynamically to maintain target precision/recall.  
- **Drift Detection** – Identify shifts in event patterns or feature distributions.  
- **Retraining Jobs** – Update client-specific models on schedule or trigger.

### 5.6 AI-Generated Insights
- Plain-language summaries highlighting anomalies, trends, and impacts.  
- Use tenant-specific prompt templates for relevance.

### 5.7 Reporting & Metrics
- APIs for querying raw and aggregated data.
- Filterable by date, campaign, product, store, and event type.

### 5.8 Alerts & Notifications
- Multi-channel delivery (webhooks, email, messaging apps).  
- Include context, impact assessment, and relevant metrics.

### 5.9 Usage Tracking & Plans
- Track processed events, API calls, and AI token usage.  
- Enforce usage limits based on subscription tier.

---

## 6. Success Criteria
- **<1 min latency** from event to alert.  
- **>90% detection accuracy** on validation datasets.  
- **≥50% reduction** in manual monitoring effort.  
- Clear and actionable AI-generated summaries.

---

## 7. Assumptions
- Clients can provide historical baseline data for calibration.
- Data quality meets minimum completeness standards.
- Clients have resources to act on alerts promptly.

---

## 8. Constraints
- Compliance with **GDPR, CCPA** and other data privacy regulations.  
- Scalable for both low-traffic and high-traffic clients.  
- MVP focuses on accuracy, reliability, and performance over breadth.

---

## 9. Risks
- Poor input data may reduce detection accuracy.  
- False positives/negatives could impact trust if not explained clearly.  
- Slow adoption if integration requires heavy client development effort.

---

## 10. Next Steps
1. Finalize architecture and multi-layer design.  
2. Define MVP backlog and milestones.  
3. Begin phased development starting with ingestion, scoring, and alerting.  
4. Onboard pilot clients for testing and feedback.
