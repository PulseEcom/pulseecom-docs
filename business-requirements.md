# PulseEcom – Business Requirements

## 1. Purpose
PulseEcom is a real-time analytics and anomaly detection platform for e-commerce businesses.  
It enables retailers and online marketplaces to monitor the “pulse” of their operations, detect anomalies instantly, and receive AI-generated insights to make faster, better decisions.

---

## 2. Goals
1. **Faster Issue Detection** – Identify fraud, sales drops, and campaign issues in seconds, not hours.
2. **Actionable Intelligence** – Convert complex data into clear, business-friendly insights.
3. **Operational Efficiency** – Reduce manual reporting and analysis efforts.
4. **Revenue Protection** – Minimize losses from undetected anomalies and inefficiencies.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope (Initial Phase)
- Multi-tenant support for multiple clients.
- Ingestion of e-commerce events via APIs and batch uploads.
- Real-time anomaly and risk scoring using AI/ML.
- AI-generated summaries of detected anomalies and performance metrics.
- Customizable reporting and alerting mechanisms.

### Out of Scope (Initial Phase)
- Native front-end dashboard UI (MVP will focus on APIs and integration).
- Automated remediation actions (will be explored in later phases).
- Complex third-party integrations beyond basic API/webhooks.

---

## 4. Target Users
- **E-commerce Analysts** – Need immediate, accurate insights into trends and anomalies.
- **Marketing Teams** – Monitor campaign effectiveness in real time.
- **Fraud & Risk Managers** – Detect and respond to suspicious activity quickly.
- **Executives** – Receive concise, AI-generated summaries for decision-making.

## 5. Key Business Requirements

### 5.1 Multi-Tenant Capability
- Each client’s data must be securely isolated.
- Admins can manage users, API keys, and configurations per tenant.

### 5.2 Data Ingestion
- Accept event data via REST API (real-time) and scheduled batch uploads.
- Support standard e-commerce event types (orders, clicks, impressions, returns).

### 5.3 Real-Time Processing
- Process incoming events with minimal latency.
- Apply enrichment rules and risk scoring in-stream.

### 5.4 AI/ML-Based Anomaly Detection
- Detect deviations from normal patterns based on historical trends.
- Support configurable thresholds and sensitivity per client.

### 5.5 AI-Generated Insights
- Convert analytics results into plain language summaries.
- Highlight what happened, why it matters, and recommended next steps.

### 5.6 Reporting & Metrics
- Provide APIs for retrieving aggregated metrics and raw event history.
- Allow filtering by time range, campaign, product, and store.

### 5.7 Alerts & Notifications
- Notify clients of critical anomalies via webhooks or other channels.
- Include context and impact details in every alert.

### 5.8 Usage Tracking & Plans
- Track number of events processed, API calls made, and AI tokens used.
- Enforce plan limits (e.g., Free, Pro tiers).

---

## 6. Success Criteria
- Detects and alerts anomalies within **1 minute** of occurrence.
- Reduces manual analysis effort by at least **50%**.
- Achieves **>90% accuracy** in anomaly detection on client test datasets.
- Provides clear, actionable summaries that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

---

## 7. Assumptions
- Clients can integrate via API or batch file delivery.
- Basic historical data is available for initial ML model training.
- Clients have staff ready to act on anomaly alerts.

---

## 8. Constraints
- Must comply with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Must support both small and high-volume e-commerce businesses.
- MVP will prioritize performance and accuracy over feature breadth.

---

## 9. Risks
- Low-quality or incomplete input data could reduce detection accuracy.
- False positives/negatives may impact client trust if not managed well.
- Delays in client integration could slow adoption.

---

## 10. Next Steps
1. Finalize high-level architecture design.
2. Define MVP backlog and delivery timeline.
3. Begin development of ingestion, processing, and alerting services.
4. Prepare onboarding documentation for pilot clients.
