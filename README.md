## Business Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses generate millions of events daily, from customer clicks to order confirmations.  
Despite having this data, many face critical challenges:
1. **Delayed Issue Detection** – Problems like fraud, bot activity, or sales drops are spotted hours or days later.
2. **Manual, Fragmented Analysis** – Insights require multiple tools and manual work, slowing down decisions.
3. **Unclear Actionability** – Even when anomalies are found, stakeholders struggle to understand and act on them.

**Impact:**  
- Lost revenue from fraud or poor-performing campaigns.  
- Wasted marketing spend.  
- Lower customer satisfaction and trust.

## Vision
PulseEcom will:
- **Ingest** data in real time from APIs, streaming systems, or batch uploads.
- **Process** and enrich events with tenant-specific business rules.
- **Score** risks and anomalies using AI/ML.
- **Summarize** findings in plain, business-friendly language.
- **Alert** stakeholders instantly via dashboards, APIs, and webhooks.
